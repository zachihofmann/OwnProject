## Predicting Peptide Retention Times

Dear all,

Thank you very much for reviewing my script to predict the retention time of peptides. I have generated a html file from the Rmd file and I would recommend to use this html file to see all explanations, code and figures. In addition, the html file was printed as a pdf and the code is also included as a R file. Finally, I have also included the data file as a text file (unmod.txt).

Best regards,

Andreas
